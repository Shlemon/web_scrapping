## WeCode-DSML Mini Recap Project


# To change MongoDB connection string, go to settings.py and change:
- MONGODB_URI
- MONGODB_DB

# To run this app:
    1. pip3 install scrapy
    2. in cmd, run: scrapy crawl quotes


# Note on app hierarchy:
- spiders/quotes.py scraps the data (author, text, tags)
- items.py is the dataclass for this project
- middlewares.py is auto generated by scrapy during runetime
- pipelines.py connects to mongodb, runs the spider, and saves data to db
- settings.py are environment variables for scrapy api


# What I'm doing with this app:
    Web scrapping for quotes, and saving the results to MongoDB.
    After that, the dataset is exported from MongoDB to pandas DataFrame and
    it's saved to disk as csv file.
